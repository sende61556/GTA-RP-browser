I'm currently developing a GTA RP experience that runs directly in the browser, and I'm looking for talented coders and passionate individuals who are eager to collaborate on this exciting project. This isn't just a one-time endeavor—it's part of a larger vision that includes multiple interconnected projects, each designed to push the boundaries of immersive roleplay and web-based gaming. Whether you're skilled in front-end development, backend systems, game design, or storytelling, there's a place for you on this journey. If you're driven, creative, and ready to build something truly unique, I’d love to have you on the team.
